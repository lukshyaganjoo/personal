Hello there! My name is Lukshya Ganjoo, and 
I'm a sophomore at the University of 
Washington, Seattle studying computer science 
and mathematics. When I'm not 
obsessing over the next big thing in 
cs theory or trying to decipher an 
algebra proof, I spend a lot of my 
time writing and finding novel ways 
to spruce up the humble bagel and toast. I am 
broadly interested in algorithmic 
design, complexity theory, spectral 
graph theory and have gained a more newfound 
appreciation for all things quantum.


If you're in the same city or are just looking to chat, I'm always looking forward to 
making new friends :). I can be reached out to on [email](mailto: 
lukshyaganjoo@cs.washington.edu), 
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/matchstickmaan/), 
[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukshya-ganjoo-163a971b0/) 
and more occasionally I hop on to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/matchstickmaan). If you're feeling incredibly fancy, you can always send me a request on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/lukshyaganjoo).

Here is an old and likely outdated copy of my [resume](images/resume.pdf)
