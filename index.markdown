Hello there! My name is Lukshya Ganjoo and 
I'm a sophomore at the University of 
Washington studying computer science 
and mathematics. When I'm not 
obssessing over the next big thing in 
cs theory or trying to decipher an 
algebra proof, I spend a lot of my 
time writing and finding novel ways 
to spruce up the humble bagel and toast. I am 
broadly interested in algorithmic 
design, complexity theory,  spectral 
graph theory and have gained a more newfound 
appreciation for all things quantum.


I can be reached out to on [email](mailto: 
lukshyaganjoo@cs.washington.edu), 
[instagram](https://www.instagram.com/matchstickmaan/) and more occasionally I hop on to [twitter](https://twitter.com/matchstickmaan). If you're feeling incredibly fancy, you can always send me a request on 
[github](https://github.com/lukshyaganjoo).

Here is an old and likely outdated copy of my [resume](images/resume.pdf)
