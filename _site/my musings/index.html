<p>For the three people who still read this, hello! I’m glad you stuck around, terribly sorry for the protracted hiatus. A lot has happened in the past year and I suppose I haven’t really prioritized writing as much as I’d like to have. Well it might have been that or the simple fact that yours truly wasn’t being funneled into a perpetual state of existential dread, but who can possibly tell, all we can do is conjecture and well, your guess is as good as mine.</p>
<p>I’ve thought about my grand re-entry into the glamorous world of blog writing for quite some time and how I could open in a manner only fitting for the high paced stakes that is the blog post. I suppose in this contrived pursuit of what can only be described as pragmatic perfection, I got wrapped up in the possibilities of what could be and not what actually was. This has been something I have been working on for some quite some time, and while I do still get caught up in all the possibilities, I have gotten better at noticing the details and actually seeing things to fruition. (Just gave myself a pat on the back for the absolutely minuscule amounts of progress I’ve made).</p>
<p>I suppose much of my life, at least the parts I fondly remember has been this sort of quest, this journey through the vast world that we know as knowledge. Perhaps not the most authentic purpose to be imbued with, but on some subconscious level, it is what motivates me, what drives me to do the things I do. When I say “knowledge”, I don’t only mean of the academic variety, of course that happens to be a major part of what I’m fascinated by, but perhaps just as intriguing is the knowledge that comes with human experience, of learning new cultures, new perspectives, meeting new people and perhaps even understanding how one becomes a better version of themself not just for them, but for those around them. This sort of “learning” has always been something I’ve been obsessed with and behind the caffeine riddled addict that is Lukshya Ganjoo, there is still that same 11 year old who lost his mind because he had just learned that there were in fact numbers of the negative variety.</p>
<p>I think that’s somewhat the main theme I’m trying to follow while writing this, this nuanced view of rebirth that acknowledges one’s roots and grows in ways that I hope have been meaningful and somewhat productive. This is a really geeky thing to bring up, but one of my favorite pieces of pop culture is the cult classic “Tron Legacy”. I can’t quite put my finger on what it was that stuck with me, but one of the main themes in that movie was faith and redemption. A father who screwed up in recognizing the things that actually mattered in his life, reborn through the regifted chance of saving his son and putting an end to his life’s work.</p>
<p>The simplicity of the story is perhaps its biggest strength, it tells a straightforward narrative and does so brilliantly. It’s a compelling story that makes for a brilliant watch. Also the music score by Daft Punk is perhaps the finest piece of synth wave I’ve heard in my life. I think faith and the hope to continue has been something we’ve all been struggling with, not just cause the world is in an absolutely debilitating state of affairs right now, but perhaps in a more personal setting.</p>
<p>Bringing it all back, my time in college has been busy to say the least. I suppose I’ve been so caught up in all my work, that I’ve somewhat lost touch with old friends, family members, the people whom I shared an entire chapter of my life with before coming here. Would I have done things differently? Yeah absolutely, but you see hindsight is a powerful tool. I’ve been making efforts to reconnect with the people I spent an almost fraction of my life with, and it’s been going well, I feel like I’ve caught up on a lot of lost ground. It goes without saying, that this is no place to stop, but I feel accomplished for actually doing something about what I thought I would regret for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>If there’s anything this place has taught me, it’s that I’m always confused, literally. And I don’t say that with contempt or the negative connotation that usually follows statements of that form, I mean that in as good of a light as being confused can be portrayed in. Remember how I mentioned that I’m obsessed with the academic variety of learning. Yeah, I think that’s fully helped me to transition into this state of acknowledgement that there is so much I don’t know, several things that I still ponder about, laying perplexed on the tiny benches this university provides. Being confused is not a bad thing though, and getting comfortable with that state of existence is something I’ve gotten really good at. There isn’t a hot minute that I’m not confronted with something that I don’t understand, and you know what, I think that’s beautiful. If nothing, it has helped alleviate at least some of the burden that I used to carry with me when learning some of the coolest shit that happens here.</p>
<p>That’s all I have for now, I think. This was a somewhat unfiltered version of my thoughts, and did not go through the level of semantic correction I normally indulge in with any given blog post of mine. I think there’s an admirable kind of power to that though, something that dare I say could be considered a breath of fresh air. For now, farewell and if time is any indicator, I will be back with more things to talk about.</p>

<p>Dealing in delirium is toying with death<br> Desperation for absolution of sin is the door to damnation <br> The dread of the desert had found its next victim<br> A poetic man, a dullard dominated by delusions of degeneracy</p>
<p>Cumbersome circumstances leave one with the illusion of free will<br> No stranger to the cruel command of creation, he raised his hands<br> Carefully cupped by his chest, directed his bones towards the vast expanse<br> He knew the labyrinth-like ways of the desert, the abominable alleys<br> How else could he have escaped from the mindless tittering of insanity?</p>
<p>He walked past the jagged crevices; the forlorn paths Marched to the beat, a soldier’s loyalty<br> Incisions of human frailty, if only the privilege of the aftermath<br> Steps in a precise cadence, a forced fealty</p>
<p>He made his way, arriving at an isolated cave for a moment’s respite<br> For he, not a moment had passed; he was summoned yet again<br> Accepted unreasonable responsibilities dutifully, not a moment’s hesitation<br> After all, how could he who forgot have known any better</p>

<p>‘Hello there’</p>
<p>I promised myself that I wasn’t going to begin a blog post with the most revered prequel meme in all of history, but believe me,</p>
<p>‘I wish I could just… wish away my feelings.’</p>
<p>There’s been a lot on my mind, things I haven’t been in a position to articulate. Now isn’t any different, but I’ve somehow managed to convince myself that erratically mashing my keyboard will make a difference.</p>
<p>Writer’s Block- it’s something people, especially writers are all too familiar with. Woeful tales of its infuriating persistence have been narrated time and again. While I understood people’s exasperation, it was only until my first-hand encounter with this mental barrier that I realised how problematic it can be. Or at least, how it might seem as such.</p>
<p>Let me explain</p>
<p>For the past 2 months or so, I’ve plastered my head in front of my computer screen at least 6 times, but the words just didn’t… flow, you know? My sentence structure seemed off, my vocabulary just didn’t fit in and worst of all, I was in this strange position where I had to force myself to head on to the google doc I normally write and edit my essays on. Writing has always been something I’ve loved, and this unexpected dread felt odd.</p>
<p>After thinking about it for some more time, however, I have reached a more rational conclusion, one that doesn’t revolve around just addressing writer’s block as a problem that needs to be solved, or rather an issue that needs to be dealt with.</p>
<p>Whenever somebody writes a story, a poem, an essay or other forms of literature that people consume, you can immediately, by the style of writing, recognise the author. They use the same words, the same literary devices, and they might even be writing on the same topic, but there’s something very distinctive about the way a person writes, an additional lens to view the same problem.</p>
<p>People change, and so does their writing style, but I don’t think it’s that simple. Perhaps writer’s block is that weird pupa-like stage of evolution where you’re changing, and nothing seems right. Perhaps the same can be said of the changes that occur in someone’s style of writing, the tone they use when conveying human issues to other people, the level of descriptiveness and the devices they use to increase the quality of their work.</p>
<p>Maybe I’m right, maybe I’m not, but I finally have an excuse for my recent inactivity, and I will not be driven insane whenever I have difficulty in trying to write what’s on my mind. Evolution in writing style can only be a good thing, and it’s quite interesting to read older works, see them from a different perspective. It’s like an entirely different person’s work.</p>
<p>Honestly, I’d love it if this never occurred, if people could just write with a new and improved voice, but I guess that’s how ‘change’ works. It takes time, and there are a lot of instances where it’s incredibly frustrating and the only viable option seems like ramming your head into a wall, to return to what you’re familiar with. Life’s greatest pleasures are only discovered after ‘seeking discomfort’. Experiment and discover, it’s the fundamental basis for every good thing, every catastrophic failure that may have occurred in the course of a lifetime. However, it’s better to be a loser at Mario Kart than an uncultured swine who hasn’t played the damn game. Yes I know that sounds incredibly pretentious but ‘Ç’est la vie’.</p>

<h1 id="my-take-on-much-of-modern-philosophy"> <a href="#my-take-on-much-of-modern-philosophy" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="my-take-on-much-of-modern-philosophy"><svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> my take on much of modern philosophy</h1>
<p>One of the things that has constantly befuddled me, is how the decision-making process works in our brain. How exactly is the ability to discern between right and wrong developed? How does our brain know what’s right and what’s wrong? And if I’m right we’re probably just slaves to an evolutionary trait.</p>
<p>Don your monocle, suit yourself up with the most expensive Prada you can find and arm yourself with a smug expression that would make your ancestors proud. We’re going to pretentious land, and this time we’re going in deep.</p>
<p>Free will is perhaps one of the most complicated areas of research in modern psychology, and I am but an uneducated swine. I do not have a degree in psychology nor do I have any qualifications in philosophy, so a fair warning: take my words with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>Charles Darwin was an English naturalist, geologist and biologist, and in addition to having some of the most kick-ass verses in ERB’s matchup against Ash Ketchum, he was responsible for propounding the “Theory of Natural Selection”, which explains how genetic traits change over time relative to habitat and environment.</p>
<p>Some of you may know where I’m going with this, in essence, if the development of our brain is a genetic trait, then well the argument ends there: we’re at the mercy of the environment, both physically and mentally.</p>
<p>But it’s interesting to note, that people now aren’t any more intelligent than they were before, the standard model of the distribution of people concerning their Intelligence Quotient has remained the same with slight changes here and there. It was a bell curve and continues to remain so. While IQ is an imperfect metric for measuring intelligence, it is the only one we possess and serves a purpose for some form of evidence to the point I’m trying to make.</p>
<p>People aren’t any smarter than they were before, but the psyche behind making decisions has definitely evolved concerning changing time and circumstances. So do we chart the former to natural selection and the other to be a clandestine constant? Well, we could, but it’s fascinating that these two deeply intertwined processes have completely different origins and paths followed.</p>
<p>Intelligence is a whole another issue, one I haven’t thought enough about, and I am in no position to speak about. Perhaps, however, the psyche behind discerning right and wrong, the question I raised at the beginning of the passage, is more interesting to think about.</p>
<p>If what I’ve said is true and the ability to distinguish between what is black and what is white is a genetic trait, then that’s a whole new curveball to our existence. Everything we’ve ever done, all the opinions we’ve forged, the discussions we’ve had, everything is just a result of adaption.</p>
<p>Survival and sustenance, perhaps the only reasons why people have different opinions. Our morality is forged from circumstance, and our circumstance is forged primarily from geographical barriers and socio-political constraints borne as a result of that primary binding. The reason why everyone has a different perspective on life, or different opinions on issues affecting us, is all a result of their fragmented understanding of how best to survive: establishing a connection with humans. We were a social animal, we will continue to remain so.</p>
<p>Strength has an odd role to play in this, but it ties into the whole scope of how some people are non-confrontational or some people are malleable in their opinion, while some are as stubborn as the mule that assisted Shrek on his journey. It’s all essentially a by-product of establishing a connection with other human beings, who ironically are doing the very same.</p>
<p>Perhaps that’s enough for today. If we do indeed have no free will, I’m not really worried. The same force has led to us making memes and sub-1-minute youtube clips from 2010 which are in every sense the most hysterical things I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p>For now, farewell and if ever in doubt, there’s always the lad on YouTube who thought he was a bush.</p>

<p>Human beings are weird. We’re filled with this strange sense of inadequacy when placed in a situation of laying ourselves bare; to people, we know very little about. There’s a prevalent thought process among us, a hindering fear of perfection in others that often times stops us from being truly ourselves with people. It’s unfortunate really considering that everyone has something they’re hiding from these seemingly perfect creatures. But you have to admit it is one of the greatest ironies that the very people who just might be able to understand the true nature of the self, are often the ones we lie most afraid of.</p>
<p>Perhaps it’s just a nihilistic approach of life to be grateful of your inadequacies, but I’m comforted by the fact that there’s a lot of things I’m abysmal at, it does accentuate the perpetuity of the hamster wheel model of endlessly running and drives people mad with the point of their existence</p>
<p>While my interpretation of life as a whole and what it offers is borne out of looking at the world through an inexperienced and naive lens, to be forever the learner and experience some of the most surreal things this world has to offer has been what drives me.</p>
<p>Its perhaps a key driving force behind my subconscious pick of friends miles ahead of me in intellect, and sometimes the inadequacy sucks, it leads you to question why you’re here or what’s even the point of doing whatever you are, for there are several better than you.</p>
<p>But just as true is perhaps the childlike joy of seeing things to do, things to look forward to, a perpetual and life-long Indiana Jones adventure.</p>
<p>Maybe our physical appearance and mental appearance fails to please us, maybe we’re unhappy with whatever we’ve achieved but I can’t help but wonder if it’s a subconscious driving force behind wanting to better ourself.</p>
<p>I don’t know about you but I can’t find a better motivator than wanting to be the best you can for the people you love; superficial or not, it shows you care.</p>
<p>That’s something huge, and although it might sound trivial its one of the most important things to learn.</p>
<p>We might not be the smartest, maybe not even the greatest at physical speciality, or several other things, but we’re not bereft of the human emotion of caring.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s all we really need.</p>

<p>What does it mean to feel? Is it perhaps a synaptic reaction that governs your behaviour towards others? Or does it have its roots in the atavistic realm of human psychology? Setting out on the thought process behind why people feel and how it affects their lives, is no mundane task and is unironically paradoxical.</p>
<p>To think is to feel and to feel is to what we hope to find a meaning for. Life is perhaps the strangest journey I’ve ever encountered, there never seems to be a linear progression between your present self and the future you choose to acheive. An interconnected hive of experiences, events that all tie into this beautiful labyrinth , that we could only hope to understand.</p>
<p>The smallest things, a seemingly trivial choice is what ends up changing a person’s life. Yet, in every decision we make, trivial or perhaps life altering, an underlying philosophy is the rationale of feeling. How we choose to treat the other, the actions we take in life and our general perspective of the world and our place in it altogether. It’s a rather strange to describe, how this ties in to everything for we cannot possibly comprehend it’s sheer complexity. Yet we know of it’s existence, a seemingly simple catalyst, the effects of which we are unclear on.</p>
<p>Love, hatred, joy, guilt, envy, anger and regret. Seemingly different compositions of the very same feeling that resides in us. An allusion to the building blocks of life that make up the entire universe. Is the universe ever so lazy for such realities to be mere coincidence, or is there something we lie unaware of, the origin of feeling in mankind, how the hunter grew to care for the living beings he hunted, how he found his way in the sea of morality.</p>
<p>Does it define our growth, of how we seem to discern between right and wrong, as the gradual realisation sinks in of the purpose of our actions. Is it the reason as to do what we do, or are our actions instead the cause of how we feel.</p>
<p>It is one of life’s most confounding trivialities, one that I cannot yet seem to comprehend. Ironic really, since that thought gives me the most solace.</p>

<p>A crippling fear of what lies beyond<br> Prevalence in terror and knowledge <br> Yet, a complete lack of direction on the subsequent step <br> Unexpected, yet moulded in a surprising rigidity</p>
<p>Several, fall victim rather recurringly <br> I must speak my mind before it claims my soul <br> A herculean task, yet my duty as a human being <br> All attempts, bound to result in failure <br> Redefining “helplessness” to something unknown</p>
<p>A bead of sweat blurs the nib <br> An unusual shine to scrawled words on the paper <br> Words rendered illegible, yet a resounding growl <br> The cursive, stops mid-way, akin to a paralysed corpse</p>
<p>Strange, perhaps due to newfangled disposition <br> Or just a naivety to unconnected circumstances <br> I welcome the unpredictable, a strange balm <br> Yet, there’s something unsettling<br> Despite a near-needled narcissism <br> I must question this dissonance in opinion</p>
<p>Silly me, I seem to have dropped something<br> Perchance, a mere triviality; just the ramblings of a madman</p>

<p>Cinders ricochet off pale hands, forged in treacherous flames. The heat was unbearable, but his hands faltered for not a second. Twas the fear of the cold , an approach in stillness akin to that of death itself. He was a survivor, one whom life had tested rather redundantly it seemed.</p>
<p>The outcome was always unary, a young boy emerging the victor, through sacrifice and toil. The night passed with the brightest of rays shining though the worn down apartment. A bold heart told him of his days of yore, those of naivety and childlike innocence. Experience was a stark reminder of this futility of thoughts.</p>
<p>He made his way over to the broken down sink and with the left over rations of food packets and half empty bottle of cranberry juice he headed over to the kitchen table. He sat over the battered table eating his morning meal, pondering over the agenda for his day. On the sight of the bloodied red pulp of his morning drink he was transported to a place he’s grown all too familiar to visiting.</p>
<p>He found himself in the Verdana running, away from what, he dared not imagine. His superior was shot down and his comrades were long gone. The remains of his Kevlar hid the bruise on the centre of his chest. Pain was an old friend, and so he soldiered on through the swirling mess of a battlefield.</p>
<p>He was back in the apartment, thankful that he had not gone away for a long time. He headed over to the grocery store for refilling the now low supply of food and daily provisions in his residence. Every begrudging step he took across the inlaid marble floor of the market, was a subtle reminder of the crucial steps “both literal and metaphorical” he took in his younger days, the smiles of people with their loved ones a dreary reminder of what he had lost.</p>
<p>She was his guiding light. A passionate young woman of about the same age who would stop at nothing to get conscripted into the army. They had met in his early days of academy training and the moment he set eyes on her, he knew that she would be the one to temper his soul. It was in those days when he was at his happiest. The days leading up to meeting her, the cheerful time spent with her training, fighting over the last bit of blue cheese and arguments over the smallest of things.</p>
<p>He cherished it all and found in her family despite being a 1000 miles away from its biological counterpart. Of all of her quirks he remembered one of them most clearly, she had a mild obsession with cranberry juice,something about the tornadoing sight of a red fluid calmed her down. He planned to tie the knot with her after they as comrades would return from that faithful mission of the Verdana. Fate as you would have it did not go as planned.</p>
<p>He made his way back to the apartment. It was growing dark now, and it was time to burn once again. This was his curse. Hopeful by day, shattered by night. A continued and confounding sense of domineering dread ruled over his life. The unified sense of struggle of millions across the world offered no alleviation either for he had endured it all; at the cost of his joy.</p>
